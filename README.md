# Web-App-Cloud (https://objectdetectionapp-szgzoob54q-oa.a.run.app/)
This project showcases the code for the deployment of a simple web-app using containers with Google App Run, allowing for Continuos Delivery (CD) and automated scalability of the application with Kubernetes. 

The application take as input a colored image, and uses a neural network trained on the COCO dataset (https://cocodataset.org/#home) to perform inference (taken from TensorflowHub: https://tfhub.dev/tensorflow/ssd_mobilenet_v2/2).
